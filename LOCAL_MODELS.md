# 🔬 Local ML Models Integration

## ✅ Your Chatbot Now Uses 100% Local Models!

No external APIs, no GPT, no cloud services - everything runs on your machine!

## 🧠 Local Models Used

1. **BERTopic** - Topic detection & clustering
2. **RoBERTa Sentiment** - Sentiment analysis (cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)
3. **Sentence Transformers** - Semantic embeddings
4. **All processing runs on your CPU/GPU**

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: Generate Data Locally
```bash
python analyze.py
```

This runs on your machine:
- ✅ Uses your CPU/GPU
- ✅ Downloads models to your machine (~500MB first time)
- ✅ Analyzes 200 posts with sentiment + topics
- ✅ Stores results in MongoDB

### Step 2: Chat with Local Data
Ask questions like:
- "What's trending about AI?"
- "Show me sentiment on healthcare"
- "Find topics about climate"

### Step 3: Analysis Runs Locally
- Searches your MongoDB for relevant posts
- Uses local BERTopic to find related topics
- Uses local RoBERTa to analyze sentiment
- Returns results instantly

## 📊 Example Output

**You:** "What's trending about AI?"

**Bot:** 🔍 Analysis of "AI" using local ML models:

**Overall Sentiment:** 45.5% positive, 22.7% negative

1. **ai is are and** (72 posts)
   📊 32 positive, 16 negative, 24 neutral

2. **tools training ai is** (28 posts)
   📊 12 positive, 8 negative, 8 neutral

**Sample Posts:**
1. 📈 AI is revolutionizing healthcare...
2. 📈 GPT models are amazing for productivity...
3. 📉 AI automation scares me...

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Models Location
Models are downloaded to:
- Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\cache\huggingface\hub\`
- Saved for reuse (no re-download needed)

### Memory Usage
- BERTopic: ~200-300MB RAM
- RoBERTa Sentiment: ~500MB RAM
- Total: ~1GB RAM for analysis

### Speed
- First analysis: ~2-3 minutes (downloading models)
- Subsequent: ~30-60 seconds (200 posts)
- Real-time chat responses: <1 second

## 💡 Advantages

✅ **Privacy**: All data stays on your machine
✅ **No API costs**: No OpenAI, no cloud fees
✅ **Offline capable**: Works without internet (after initial model download)
✅ **Customizable**: Modify models, add training data
✅ **Transparent**: See exactly what models are running

## 🎯 Usage Workflow

1. **Initial Setup** (run once):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python analyze.py
   ```

2. **Start Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Chat with Your Data**:
   - Ask questions in the chatbot
   - Results come from your local MongoDB
   - Analysis uses your local models

4. **Refresh Data** (when needed):
   ```bash
   python analyze.py  # Re-runs analysis
   ```

## 📁 What Gets Generated

### MongoDB Collections
```javascript
posts: {
  text: "AI is revolutionizing...",
  topic: 0,
  topic_name: "ai is are and",
  sentiment: "POSITIVE",
  score: 0.92,
  timestamp: "2025-10-29T..."
}
```

### Python Models
```
C:\Users\...\cache\huggingface\hub\
├── cardiffnlp__twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest/
├── sentence-transformers__all-MiniLM-L6-v2/
└── bertopic/
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**"No posts found about [keyword]"**
```bash
# Regenerate data with local models
python analyze.py
```

**"Models downloading slowly"**
- First time takes 5-10 minutes
- Subsequent runs are instant
- Models are cached locally

**"Chatbot not responding"**
- Check if MongoDB is running
- Verify .env.local has correct MONGO_URI
- Run: `python analyze.py` to populate data

## 🎨 Customization

### Modify Sentiment Threshold
Edit `analyze.py`:
```python
if result["score"] > 0.7:  # Adjust threshold
    sentiment_label = "POSITIVE"
```

### Change Topic Count
```python
topic_model = BERTopic(
    nr_topics=10,  # Force specific number
    ...
)
```

### Use Different Models
```python
# In analyze.py, change model:
sentiment_model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", 
    model="nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"
)
```

## ✅ Benefits Over Cloud APIs

| Feature | Local Models | Cloud APIs |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Cost | $0 (free) | $$$ per request |
| Speed | Fast (localhost) | Network latency |
| Privacy | 100% secure | Data leaves your machine |
| Control | Full control | Dependency on service |
| Offline | Works offline | Requires internet |
